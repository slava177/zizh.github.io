#excerpt: 'Autonomous systems must have the ability to quickly adapt to various situations. However, adaptation methods often require strong assumptions about system structures, environmental homogeneity, and multiple rollouts. In this work, we integrate multi-armed bandit and model-based RL to design a fast adaptation algorithm on a single trajectory. Our approach achieves sublinear regret, and the performance guarantee does not require homogeneity of the environment. This regret bound is achieved using a novel prediction error metric that is minimized in the ground-truth MDP. To the best of our knowledge, all existing results with provable guarantees depend on the Bregman divergence between the optimal policies among the MDP's. We show by simulation that our algorithm performs well in puzzle navigation and quadcopter path-tracking.'

Policy design in non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is inherently challenging due to the complexities introduced by time-varying system transition and reward, which make it difficult for learners to determine the optimal actions for maximizing cumulative future rewards. Fortunately, in many practical applications, such as energy systems, look-ahead predictions are available, including forecasts for renewable energy generation and demand. In this paper, we leverage these look-ahead predictions and propose an algorithm designed to achieve low regret in non-stationary MDPs by incorporating such predictions. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, the regret decreases exponentially as the look-ahead window expands. When the system prediction is subject to error, the regret does not explode even if the prediction error grows sub-exponentially as a function of the prediction horizon. We validate our approach through simulations, confirming the efficacy of our algorithm in non-stationary environments.
