#excerpt: 'Autonomous systems must have the ability to quickly adapt to various situations. However, adaptation methods often require strong assumptions about system structures, environmental homogeneity, and multiple rollouts. In this work, we integrate multi-armed bandit and model-based RL to design a fast adaptation algorithm on a single trajectory. Our approach achieves sublinear regret, and the performance guarantee does not require homogeneity of the environment. This regret bound is achieved using a novel prediction error metric that is minimized in the ground-truth MDP. To the best of our knowledge, all existing results with provable guarantees depend on the Bregman divergence between the optimal policies among the MDP's. We show by simulation that our algorithm performs well in puzzle navigation and quadcopter path-tracking.'

We study the problem of stabilizing an unknown partially observable linear time-invariant (LTI) system. For fully observable systems, leveraging an unstable/stable subspace decomposition approach, state-of-art sample complexity is independent from system dimension n and only scales with respect to the dimension of the unstable subspace. However, it remains open whether such sample complexity can be achieved for partially observable systems because such systems do not admit a uniquely identifiable unstable subspace. In this paper, we propose LTS-P, a novel technique that leverages compressed singular value decomposition (SVD) on the ''lifted'' Hankel matrix to estimate the unstable subsystem up to an unknown transformation. Then, we design a stabilizing controller that integrates a robust stabilizing controller for the unstable mode and a small-gain-type assumption on the stable subspace. We show that LTS-P stabilizes unknown partially observable LTI systems with state-of-the-art sample complexity that is dimension-free and only scales with the number of unstable modes, which significantly reduces data requirements for high-dimensional systems with many stable modes.
