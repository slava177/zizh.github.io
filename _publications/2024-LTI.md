#excerpt: 'Autonomous systems must have the ability to quickly adapt to various situations. However, adaptation methods often require strong assumptions about system structures, environmental homogeneity, and multiple rollouts. In this work, we integrate multi-armed bandit and model-based RL to design a fast adaptation algorithm on a single trajectory. Our approach achieves sublinear regret, and the performance guarantee does not require homogeneity of the environment. This regret bound is achieved using a novel prediction error metric that is minimized in the ground-truth MDP. To the best of our knowledge, all existing results with provable guarantees depend on the Bregman divergence between the optimal policies among the MDP's. We show by simulation that our algorithm performs well in puzzle navigation and quadcopter path-tracking.'

We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up exponentially in the state dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the n-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than n. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm is only exponential in the order of the dimension of the unstable subspace and is advantagous if the unstable subspace is small. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.
