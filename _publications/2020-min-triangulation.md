We classify all tuples of lattice polyhedra of relative mixed volume 1 and all minimal (by inclusion) tuples of polyhedra of relative mixed volume 2. We also prove a conjecture by Esterov, which states that all tuples with finite relative mixed volume are contained in one of finitely many ones that are minimal by inclusion.
